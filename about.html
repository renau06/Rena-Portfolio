        <div id="aboutmedescription"> So, who am I? --- A college student, a karate master, and a famous Vogue star. Okay, maybe I am not THAT cool, but I am a college student, a black belt in karate, and I was once in a 73 Questions with Vogue YouTube video. I currently am studying computer science and economics at Northwestern University. I am a front-end and back-end coder, with experience in Python, Javascript, C++, C, C#, HTML, and CSS. My passion lies in the intersection of elegant designs and efficient code. You can usually find me designing/coding or strumming my guitar or playing tennis or enjoying the outdoors. One belief that I live by is to never do the same exact thing you did yesterday.  </div>
